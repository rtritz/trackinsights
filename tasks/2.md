Focus on making the homepage AMAZING! We want this to have the "wow" factor when users visit our site. Also, determine what we want in the base.html (headers, footers, etc.) and formalize that. Explore the photo slideshow option, and see what you think of that compared to a video. You can find the IndyStar photos here:
