Review the feedback we received about the design and continue working on the design. 
- Try placing the search box in the middle of the home page to see what that looks like. The downside is that it will block part of the photo, but that may be ok. The benefit is that the user will not have to scroll to see / use it.
- Remove the label above the search textbox (e.g. "Search for your school or athlete") and instead update the gray text in the search box to "Search for an athlete". This should be intuitive to the user.

Investigate the search query logic to see if we can make it more efficient. For now we won't worry about adding schools in the query. You may comment out the logic that handles schools. This is something we will come back to at a later point. 

Test the search logic to try to break it. As we talked about, there were some times when it was functioning unexpectedly.

Collate the feedback we received into a spreadsheet and share that out to the group. 

Build the infrastructure to include relays on an athlete dashboard. 
- Update the relay_result table to include an "relay_id" field. Set this field as the new PK.
- Create a new table called "relay_athlete". This is a junction table that will include two fields: "relay_id" and "athlete_id". Set these two fields as the PK.
- Write a program that does the following:
```
Iterates through all the `relay_result` rows,  
  Splits the `"athlete_names"` into four names  
    Iterates through the four names  
      Search for the athlete in the `athlete` table, using first name, last name, and school. There are no duplicates.
      If found,
        get athlete_id.
      else
       add a new entry in the `athlete` table. Leave `grad_year` blank for now and we'll update it later.  get athlete_id
      Add an entry in the `relay_athlete` table w/ the current `relay_id` and `athlete_id`.
```
We will update the web scrapping code to populate the relay_athlete table for the future.
