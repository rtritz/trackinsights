Continue working on the website design. If you have the opportunity to solicit feedback from a wide range of people, that would be very helpful. Show them the home page and ask what they like, dislike, and what recommendations they may have. The more people you ask, the better. 

If you want a break from the design, you can work and incorporating Personal Best data on the athlete dashboard. Go to Task 2 to see an example of what it may look like. Coordinate with Owen if you have questions on the queries. 

## Owen
Build queries to return ranking information. Ranking information will be specific to: Year, Gender, Event, Meet Type. Below is the ranking information we want. 
- (a) among all athletes (e.g. 27 / 183)
- (b) among "like schools" -- these include schools that are w/i an enrollment size of 25% of the athletes school, and
- (c) among same grade as that athlete grade for this result

The rank information is specific to Year, Gender, Event, Meet Type. For example, say a male athlete ran a 51.30 in the 400 during the 2024 Sectional. When he clicks this result (51.30) on his dashboard, it will take him to another page showing the rankings. In this example, the rankings will be specific to 2024 Sectional Boys 400.

1) Verify grad_year is correct in the athlete_table. More specifically, check where there were null grade levels. 
   
2) See me when you are ready to merge your DB updates to the main repository.
   
3) Clean the percentile code to use constants, etc.
      
4) Add athlete "grade_level" to the get_percentiles function, so we can query by grade level. Here is what the function will now look like. 

```python
def get_percentiles(
    events=None,                # tuple of events to include in results. None means all events.
    genders=None,               # tuple of genders to include in results. None means both Boys and Girls.
    percentiles=(25, 50, 75),   # tuple of percentiles to include in results.
    years=None,                 # tuple of years to include in calculation, or None
    meet_types=None,            # tuple of meet types to include in calculation, or None
    grade_level=None            # tuple of grade levels to include in calculation, or None
```
